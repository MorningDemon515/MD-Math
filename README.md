# MD-Math
A Math Lib

The library has a header file and a source file that provides a lot of computational functions and something about linear algebra that you can use as an alternative to glm or XMath, happy to use!

## Concentrate! I kept the old version of the source file (MD_Math.c) but it doesn't work anymore, so don't use the old version of the source file!
