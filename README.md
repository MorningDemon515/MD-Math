# MD-Math
A Math Lib

The library has a header file and a source file that provides a lot of computational functions and something about linear algebra that you can use as an alternative to glm or XMath, happy to use!

# Added: Functions MD_Math_MatrixToValue can convert the type of matrix to an array
